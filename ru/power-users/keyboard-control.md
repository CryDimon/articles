If you begrudge every millisecond spent reaching for the mouse or trackpad, you'll be delighted to know that you can use the keyboard for most operations in Kato! It's a special feature that we call *Keyboard Control*. 

To enable Keyboard Control, go to ![clip.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/2b9ca8dddd30d4b02b589b711204c953fb9a9aba105f87dbd326401b8ff6c7b6/clip.png) `-> My Account -> Options -> Keyboard Control`, or paste this URL into your Kato tab: <a href="https://app.kato.im/#/account/options/keyboard-control" target="_blank">https://app.kato.im/#/account/options/keyboard-control</a>

The most important thing to know about Keyboard Control is that it has two modes: **Command mode** is for navigating the interface and moving rooms around. **Input mode** is for entering and sending messages. You go between these modes using **Esc** and **i**â€”see below for details.

(**Tip**: Keyboard Control follows many conventions established by the popular text editor [vi/vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). This means: when in doubt, hit **Esc**!)

If you have questions, suggestions, or bug reports, please let us know in your [Kato support room](room-types), or via [support@kato.im](mailto:support@kato.im)
