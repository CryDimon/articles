Sometimes you want to send a very long message, but you don't want it to overwhelm the chat history.

So if you send a message with more than 2000 characters, Kato will put the whole thing into a new document, and show the first part of the message along with a link to the document.

This works for normal text entry, and also for [Markdown](cheatsheet/#markdown) and [Code](cheatsheet/#code) formatting. [Editing](cheatsheet/#typos) long messages also works normally.

### Plain Text
For example, pasting the source of an email from Salman Khan at the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) into Kato results in this:

Clicking the link opens the message in a new browser:

### Markdown

Pasting a large chunk of [Markdown](cheatsheet/#markdown) (if the chat room has Markdown turned on), shows this:

Click the link to see the whole message:

### Code

To paste code, turn on [Code](cheatsheet/#code) formatting:

If you're using the [Keyboard Control](https://kato.im/articles/keyboard-control/) feature, **`c`** will turn on Code formatting.

Currently, Kato doesn't show the first part of a long Code messageâ€”just the link:

Clicking the link shows the whole long code message:
