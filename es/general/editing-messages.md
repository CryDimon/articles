You can edit your last message for **two minutes** after you send it. To do this, click the message box and press **Up-Arrow**. You'll see a green highlight next to the message being edited. The message box will turn green too:

When you're done editing, press **Enter** to update the message.

#### Tips:
- When you have about **10 seconds** left, the message box will start flashing blue.
- To cancel an edit in progress, press **Esc**.
- To restore a cancelled edit, press **Ctrl-Z** (**Command-Z** on Mac).
- If you send after the time is up, the edited text will become a new message.
- A pencil icon appears next to an edited message. The pencil is visible to anyone viewing that room, until they close the room.
- You can't delete a message this way. You can't replace it with spaces either. To "retract" a message, just replace it with a hyphen ('-') or similar.
