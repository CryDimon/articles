No enterprise system is complete without a security audit log. This includes communication and collaboration systems. Hey—this includes Kato! This is why we’re so excited to announce a new feature today: security audit log.

## Motivation

What’s a security audit log? It’s a room that contains an immutable record of important things that happen in your Kato organization, but that nobody knows about—unless you have a security audit log! Consider these unpleasant possibilities:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Important Thing</b></td>
        <td><b>Threat</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Changing a display name or email address</td>
        <td>Impersonation, identity theft</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Granting admin status</td>
        <td>Inappropriate power</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Revoking admin status</td>
        <td>Sabotage, “hostage-taking” of content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adding people to the organization</td>
        <td>Voyeurism</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Removing people from the organization</td>
        <td>Vandalism</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Creating restricted rooms</td>
        <td>Establishes private channel for sharing sensitive content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Deleting or renaming rooms</td>
        <td>Malicious destruction or unexplained disappearance of content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Changing a restricted room’s access list</td>
        <td>Sensitive data spreads throughout the organization</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Changing a room’s restricted status</td>
        <td>Sensitive data becomes visible to unintended audience</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Making a room public</td>
        <td>Outsiders and competitors can see private data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Enabling a security audit log</td>
        <td>Inappropriate observation of user activity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Disabling a security audit log</td>
        <td>All of the above</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Example

Here’s what the security audio log looks like in a room where an admin has enabled it:

## Instructions

To get your own security audit log, you have to have administrative access. Once you do, follow these steps:

1. Create a room, restricted or unrestricted&#8212;up to you. If you’re really **Enterprise**, with a capital **E**, make it restricted. We suggest giving this room a descriptive name, like *Audit Log*.

2. Enable the *Audit Log* integration:

3. Sleep easier.
