The world is quickly coming to terms with the realization that team chat is the way to go, when it comes to everyday workspace communication.

While that's great, voice conferencing is not only not going away, it's actually getting pretty darn great.

<a href="https://www.uberconference.com/">UberConference</a> fixes all the broken and outdated aspects of traditional conference calling, giving you a simple and pain-free way to schedule and run audio conferences without the hassle of PIN numbers. With the UberConference visual interface, you can share your screen, share documents, control calls with a click, and see who’s there and who’s talking.

The Kato integration with UberConference uses the new <a href="https://www.uberconference.com/developers">UberConference API</a> to start a new call and share its details in Kato, similar to the <a href="/articles/en/voice-video/google-hangouts-integration">integration with Google Hangouts</a>.
