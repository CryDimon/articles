If you're using **Google Chrome** or **Firefox**, you can share your screen with another Kato user. Here's how:

**1. Enable [Video/Voice Calling](/articles/en/voice-video/video-voice-calling)**

  This can be done by an admin in your Kato organization.

**2. Start a video call**

Select the video camera icon:

You’ll see yourself on camera, and also a message like this:

  Wait for collaborators to join (by clicking on *Video* or *Voice* in the message on their side).

**3: Screenshare!**

(Chrome users will need [this browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/katoim-screensharing/elfaklmcfkabijfpimckfggeaafceecn). Just follow the instructions after clicking the screenshare button. If nothing happens, your browser isn't supported—sorry!)
