Kato Video/voice calling lets you see and hear your team in real time, without leaving Kato!

Video/voice calling is supported in **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Opera** browsers. It's part of **Kato Labs**. That means it's experimental, so an Admin has to enable it in [organization settings](https://app.kato.im/#/membership/):

Once that's done, you can choose **Start call** from a room's message options:

That puts a call message in the room:

A video call will start automatically. To start a voice call, first close the video call, then click on the **Voice** button.

To join the call, click one of the buttons. Anyone who sees the message can join. Anyone on the call can invite others to the same call, by posting a **Start call** message in any room, in any organization.
