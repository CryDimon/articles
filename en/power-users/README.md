This section focuses on advanced features&#8212;not necessary for everyday use, but very nice to have when you need them.

[**Markdown**](/articles/en/power-users/m-for-markdown) is a method of [rich formatting](/articles/en/power-users/markdown-syntax) that lets you compose messages with lists, embedded images, bold and italic text, hyperlinks, and more.

[**Keyboard Control**](/articles/en/power-users/keyboard-control) lets you work in Kato without the use of a mouse. You can open and close teams, open, close, pin and unpin rooms, move rooms around, search, navigate message history, and more. The feature is largely based on the keyboard interface principles seen in the vi/Vim text editor.

[**Integrations**](/articles/en/power-users/integrations) let you pipe notifications from other tools and services into Kato rooms. For example, commits, comments, and pull requests from GitHub or Bitbucket can appear as Kato messages. We recommend creating dedicated rooms for various integrations, instead of piping automated messages into rooms used by humans.
