Managing noise is a crucial aspect of a communication system, especially as the organization grows. Too many notifications, and you can't get anything done. Too few, and you miss important stuff. Kato has a flexible approach for managing the demands on your attention.

First of all, you'll always get an immediate notification when someone sends you a message in the **[1:1 room](/articles/en/general/room-types)** that you share with that person.

You'll also get an immediate notification when you are **mentioned** in any room. Mentioning someone is a great way to get their attention.

For normal [restricted or unrestricted rooms](/articles/en/general/room-types), you can choose a **noise level** using the menu in the room header. The menu icon shows the current noise level:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Icon</td>
    <td>Noise&nbsp;level</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/4a673be5e1c5e59a4363edf33c76ca2fb580e381565b51f628167e3c626ab4d8/clip.png" /></td>
    <td><b>Follow</b></td><td>Any messages posted in the room will be added to your unread counters, and will result in notifications</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/662c1f1551b8fee88b8fa26d7244ac6a6c29852397ec3d0e93da63c5b245d11/clip.png" /></td>
    <td><b>Watch</b></td><td>Any messages posted in the room will be added to your unread counters, but will not result in notifications (unless you are mentioned—see above)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/5d58f5ead3667f997dacf0798d1df99ba6071839ff8c2f47eafcf125f19dec/clip.png" /></td>
    <td><b>Ignore</b></td><td>the room will not contribute to your unread message count, and you will not get notifications (unless you are mentioned—see above)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you set the noise level for a specific room, it will be shown in _italic_: ![clip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/817e344293c1db147d7db14dc0a2bf339d132401c8bb50b6dca8ddba77fc4f3/clip.png) vs ![clip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/599ad9a8bc930bfe51ae45f6698218aa1f08e53117739f02d03ad91b28395c5/clip.png). Adjusting noise levels as conversations evolve is a good way to minimize unnecessary distractions. That's why Kato noise controls are always in view.

## <a href="#noise-account" name="noise-account">Account-Level Default Noise Settings</a>
You can set a default noise level for each [room type](/articles/en/general/room-types) in your account settings. **Tip:** as a shortcut, you can paste this URL into your Kato browser tab: *https://app.kato.im/#/account/noise*

## <a href="#noise-organization" name="noise-organization">Organization-Level Default Noise Settings</a>
Admins can set the default noise level for each room type, across the organization. Your default noise levels will override those. **Tip:** as a shortcut, you can paste this URL into your Kato browser tab: *https://app.kato.im/#/membership/_/noise*

## <a href="#noise-room" name="noise-room">Room-Level Default Noise Settings</a>
Admins can also set the default noise level for a specific room, across the organization. Your default noise levels won't override that, but your own setting for that specific room will—so you win.

Whew! It's all a bit much. Happily, most users and admins don't have to worry about it. Kato's noise management options are powerful, but entirely optional—you can ignore them forever, or tailor things to your liking with just a few clicks.
