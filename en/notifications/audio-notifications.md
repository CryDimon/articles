Kato can get your attention using sound as well as visual notifications. You can enable audio notifications in your [Account settings](https://app.kato.im/#/account/notifications/audio-notifications).

If you do, you'll hear a gentle *pop* any time you're specifically mentioned, or if you receive a message in a 1-1 room. It's a subtle way to draw your attention back to potentially important messages.
