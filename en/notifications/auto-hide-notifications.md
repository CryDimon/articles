This feature applies only if you're using the **Google Chrome** browser.

You can keep an eye on important conversations even when Kato isn't in front. If Kato isn't the selected tab in your browser, or even if your browser isn't the frontmost application on your computer, you'll get a popup desktop notification. The notification will show briefly and then automatically hide.

If you'd rather dismiss each notification individually, you can disable the auto-hide behavior from your Account settings.
