[IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) (**I**f **T**his, **T**hen **T**hat) is a free service that lets you connect together various web applications, like Dropbox, Facebook...and now [Kato](https://ifttt.com/kato)!

Kato ⟷ IFTTT integration is two-way: you can use Kato both as a **trigger** and a **source** for IFTTT. We encourage everyone to try their hand in cooking something interesting!

For example, a message posted to a Kato room can light up your [Blink(1) LED notification light](http://blink1.thingm.com/). Or, you can see a message in a Kato room whenever a new [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com) comic is available. There are countless possibilities for creating all sorts of integrations—IFTTT calls them _Recipes_—for business and fun.

Here are some of our favorite Recipes. We've shared them on our [IFTTT channel](https://ifttt.com/kato).

## Kato → Google Spreadsheets

<a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/207259-message-in-kato-adds-a-row-in-google-spreadsheets" target = "_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_49" id= "embed_recipe-207259"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/207259' alt="IFTTT Recipe: Message in Kato adds a row in Google Spreadsheets connects kato to google-drive" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script><br />
This Recipe is a great way of keeping a work log for your team: create a room called "Work Log" and have everyone post a message whenever they start on a new task. If you connect this room to a Google Spreadsheet via IFTTT, you'll end up with a document that you can annotate, clean up, and share.

## Kato → iOS Reminders

<a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/209885-turn-messages-in-a-kato-room-into-ios-reminders" target = "_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_47" id= "embed_recipe-209885"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/209885' alt="IFTTT Recipe: Turn messages in a Kato room into iOS reminders connects kato to ios-reminders" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script><br />
Kato doesn't have built-in reminders (yet!). Until then, this is a pretty good workaround: create a "Reminders" room, enable this Recipe, and your iPhone will show messages from that room as reminders.

## Your location → Kato

### iOS
<a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/209845-posts-to-kato-when-you-enter-or-exit-hq" target = "_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_39" id= "embed_recipe-209845"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/209845' alt="IFTTT Recipe: Posts to Kato when you enter or exit HQ connects ios-location to kato" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script>
### Android
<a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/209852-posts-to-kato-when-you-enter-or-exit-hq" target = "_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_39" id= "embed_recipe-209852"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/209852' alt="IFTTT Recipe: Posts to Kato when you enter or exit HQ connects android-location to kato" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script><br />
Believe it or not, with this Recipe your phone (iOS or Android) can let your team know when you enter or leave the office.

## Dropbox → Kato

<a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/204301-dropbox-to-kato" target = "_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_15" id= "embed_recipe-204301"><img src= 'https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/204301' alt="IFTTT Recipe: Dropbox to Kato connects dropbox to kato" width="370px" style="max-width:100%"/></a><script async type="text/javascript" src= "//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script><br />
Adding an item to a Dropbox folder can post a message to a Kato room. Let's say you've hired an external, part-time bookkeeper. Give that person access to your "Bookkeeping" Kato room and they'll see a notification whenever you drop a new photo of a receipt into your "New Items" Dropbox folder.
