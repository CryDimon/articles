Team membership in Kato does not imply an isolated idenity, one unique to a team. Therefore, you can work on multiple teams, maintaining the same 1-1 histories with people with whom you share memberhsip across multiple teams. Additionally, you can work with rooms and people belonging to different teams at the same time.

In the example below, Calliope is a member of three teams&#8212;**Fireplace Sales**, **Fireplace Marketing**, and **Fireplace, Inc.**, with the last two active, and **Fireplace Sales** _closed_, with 6 unread messages in _watched_ rooms (see [Noise Control](/articles/en/notifications/noise-control)).
