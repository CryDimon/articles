Kato can add your colleagues to your Kato team automatically, based on email addresses. You can tell Kato to do this as part of your own signup, by *claiming the domain* that is part of your signup email address. (The domain is after the "@".)

Claiming a domain means that any Kato account with the same email domain as yours will automatically be added to your Kato team. This will happen for any current Kato account holders, as well as new ones as they sign up.

You can't claim a domain that has already been claimed, and you can't claim an established domain like `gmail.com`. If you claim a domain by mistake, contact us in your [Kato support room](/articles/en/general/room-types).
