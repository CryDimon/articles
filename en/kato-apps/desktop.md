# OS X App (Safari Wrapper)

You can download this [**old version** of Kato for Mac OS X](http://labs.kato.im/Kato.pkg).

It's based on [MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1), and it's got some issues:

- Audible notifications don't always work right
- There's no WebRTC support for audio/video calls or screensharing
- You can't paste images into chat
<!-- - You can't use [Kato Roll](cheatsheet#kato-roll) -->

But the main issue is that it is very hard to debug, and we don't want to put much more effort into it, because it's a dead end. We'd much rather keep working on the new versions.

That said, there are upsides: you'll see red notification numbers in the Dock, and you can use command-tab to get in and out.

So we're making it available here in Kato Labs, strictly for the adventurous. Let us know about issues, but we don't promise to address them right away. Enjoy!
